## Results

### Freshers

Note that all the 4 freshers' teams got the same position.

**Ambisonic-player by Hack-a-ton -** [Code](https://github.com/LakshyAAAgrawal/Ambisonic-player)

_Members: Lakshya, Ritwik, Bhavya, Ruhma_

Implemented the "8D" audio, audio that seems to be revolving about the listener. 
The app takes a youtube link as an input and then plays that song as an 
"Ambisonic" version.

 

**SMSSieve by Bob: The Bylders -** [Code](https://github.com/confusement/SMSieve/)

_Members: Naman, Sudhir, Ayush, Anmol_

An Android application that reads the SMS on the phone and filters out meaningful information like promo codes, missed calls etc. 

**Elysian by !Banana -** [Code](https://github.com/singlautsav/chidiya_lets_udd) 

_Members: Utsav, Vasu, Sonali, Isha_

A mobile app that lets you play chidiya udd with a more realistic playing experience than existing apps.

 

**PasswordBanao by Binary Bombers -** [Code](https://github.com/singlautsav/chidiya_lets_udd)

_Members: Diptanshu, Himanshu, Rushil, Abhinay_

Authenticate yourself using a file, like music, text or image, rather than your plain old password. 

### Seniors


**Scre{w}ber by Code Slingers -** [Code](https://github.com/harshj94/Screwber) 

_Members: Harsh, Ayush, Swagatam, Kanika_

The app will suggest the user to break his/her journey at a point where the
surge price ends in the route from source to destination. This will 
help users to save a lot of money during peak pricing. The app will 
provide the stats of expected time spent in break journey, money saved, 
cabs available at breakpoint etc.

### Special Mentions

We really liked these projects but unfortunately, they didn't make it. Better luck next time! P.S. We have stickers for you.

**InstaClick by Bob The Bylder**

_Vrinda, Pragyan, Adwit, Anunay_

Take a photo of you and your friends at your most momentous times together, by automatic expression detection.

**LockChecker by Anonymous**

_Rahul, Setu_

This hardware contraption installed in your padlock tells you if your door is locked
 or not. If you are at a far off place and are worried if you locked 
your door or not, then this might be great for you
